# Codex Integration Guide

---

## Overview
AxonHub can act as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI endpoints, letting Codex connect through your own infrastructure. This guide explains how to configure Codex and how to combine it with AxonHub model profiles for flexible routing.

### Key Points
- AxonHub performs AI protocol/format transformation. You can configure multiple upstream channels (providers) and expose a single OpenAI-compatible interface for Codex.
- You can aggregate Codex requests from the same conversation by enabling `server.trace.codex_trace_enabled` (uses `Session_id`) or adding extra headers via `server.trace.extra_trace_headers`.
- Codex scheduled automations are supported even when the app starts them with an `automation_update` output that has no `call_id`.

### Prerequisites
- AxonHub instance reachable from your development machine.
- Valid AxonHub API key with project access.
- Access to Codex (OpenAI compatible) application.
- Optional: one or more model profiles configured in the AxonHub console.

### Configure Codex
1. Edit `${HOME}/.codex/config.toml` and register AxonHub as a provider:
   ```toml
   model = "gpt-5"
   model_provider = "axonhub-responses"

   [model_providers.axonhub-responses]
   name = "AxonHub using Responses"
   base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1"
   env_key = "AXONHUB_API_KEY"
   wire_api = "responses"
   query_params = {}
   ```
2. Export the API key for Codex to read:
   ```bash
   export AXONHUB_API_KEY="<your-axonhub-api-key>"
   ```
3. Restart Codex to apply the configuration.

#### Model catalog refresh

Codex discovery requests `GET /v1/models?client_version=0.153.4`. AxonHub treats a non-empty `client_version` query parameter as a request for the Codex `{"models":[{"slug":"…",…}]}` catalog. No extra AxonHub setting is required. Ordinary `/v1/models` requests still return the OpenAI `data/id` format; `include=all` alone does not select Codex format.

The catalog contains only models visible to the current API key, using the same project/profile and model-list settings as ordinary discovery. Enabled models are shown in the Codex picker, including entries hidden by the bundled upstream catalog. The endpoint does not forward your key to OpenAI or fetch a remote catalog per request.

Known models use the complete bundled Codex **0.153.4** descriptors, preserving instructions, reasoning options, tools, and service tiers. The client's longest-prefix and single provider-namespace lookup also applies to dated or prefixed names. For example, Astra retains a default `context_window` of **272000** and a `max_context_window` of **872000**; the maximum is not the default. This versioned snapshot is separate from AxonHub's general model/pricing catalog sync.

Unrecognized models use that Codex version's generic fallback instructions and metadata. An explicitly configured model card's positive context limit replaces the generic **272000** fallback; otherwise this is a client default, not a verified provider capacity. Configure the actual limit for custom models. Reasoning levels and service tiers are not guessed from other models.

To inspect the response with your existing key:

```bash
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/models?client_version=0.153.4' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AXONHUB_API_KEY"
```

This fixes the response format when Codex makes a discovery request; it does not force the client to refresh. Codex 0.153.4 only attempts remote refresh for Codex-backend or command-auth configurations, not ordinary custom providers using only an API key. Explicitly selecting a model and sending chat requests remains a separate path. Older or newer clients with different catalog contracts may need a matching snapshot update.

#### Trace aggregation by conversation (important)
Enable the built-in Codex trace extraction to reuse the `Session_id` header as the trace ID:

```yaml
server:
  trace:
    codex_trace_enabled: true
```

If Codex sends a different stable conversation identifier header (for example `Conversation_id`), you can configure AxonHub to use it as a fallback trace header in `config.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  trace:
    extra_trace_headers:
      - Conversation_id
```

**Note**: Enabling this also ensures that requests from the same trace are prioritized to be sent to the same upstream channel, significantly improving provider-side cache hit rates (e.g., Anthropic Prompt Caching).

#### Testing
- Send a sample prompt; with the configuration above, AxonHub's request logs should show a `/v1/responses` call.
- Enable tracing in AxonHub to inspect prompts, responses, and latency.

### Working with Model Profiles
AxonHub model profiles remap incoming model names to provider-specific equivalents:
- Create a profile in the AxonHub console and add mapping rules (exact name or regex).
- Assign the profile to your API key.
- Switch active profiles to alter Codex behavior without changing tool settings.

      </a>
      <br/>
      Model Profiles

  </tr>
</table>

#### Example
- Request `gpt-4` → mapped to `deepseek-reasoner` for getting more accurate responses.
- Request `gpt-3.5-turbo` → mapped to `deepseek-chat` for reducing costs.

### Troubleshooting
- **Codex reports authentication errors**: ensure `AXONHUB_API_KEY` is exported in the same shell session that launches Codex.
- **Unexpected model responses**: review active profile mappings in the AxonHub console; disable or adjust rules if necessary.
- **Scheduled automation reports that `function_call_output` requires `call_id`**: upgrade AxonHub to a build containing the Codex automation bootstrap compatibility fix.

## Provider Quota Tracking

AxonHub automatically tracks quota usage for Codex provider channels, displaying the current status with battery icons in the interface.

### How It Works

- **Automatic Polling**: AxonHub periodically polls your Codex account to check quota status
- **Storage**: Quota data is stored in the database and updated based on the configured check interval
- **Visual Indicators**: Battery icons show your remaining quota at a glance.

### Quota Windows

Codex uses multiple quota windows:
- **Primary window**: Main usage limit with a configurable duration (e.g., 5 hours, 1 day)
- **Secondary window**: Optional secondary usage limit with its own duration and reset schedule

The system shows both window percentages including the primary window duration and reset time.

### Configuration

Adjust the quota check interval in `config.yml`:

```yaml
provider_quota:
  check_interval: "5m"           # Check every 5 minutes (default)
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export AXONHUB_PROVIDER_QUOTA_CHECK_INTERVAL="30m"
```

Supported intervals: `1m`, `2m`, `3m`, `4m`, `5m`, `6m`, `10m`, `12m`, `15m`, `20m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, etc.

**Recommendations:**
- **Development**: Use shorter intervals (e.g., `5m`) for quick feedback
- **Production**: Use `5m` (default) for timely quota detection; increase to `10m` or `20m` to reduce API calls

### Refreshing Quota Data

You can manually trigger a quota refresh by clicking the refresh icon in the quota status popover.

### Viewing Quota Status

1. Look for the battery icon next to the settings gear in the header
2. Click the battery icon to view detailed quota information including:
   - Primary window usage percentage and duration
   - Primary window reset time
   - Plan type (if available)
   - Secondary window usage (if configured)
